 Chunchunmaru! is a kernel based on Android Linux Stable and is mean't to be a clean and simple kernel to use as stock kernel  in my upcoming POSP builds

 Upstreamed to 4.9.215
 Merged the latest CAF tag for msm8953: LA.UM.8.6.2.r1-06600-89xx.0
 
 Features:
 - DT2W for Goodix_TS and FTS_TS Users!
 - Fingerprint gestures (for FPC and Goodix users)
 - Use the by Google recommended timer frequency 300hz
 - Removed safetynet flags (there is no need for magisk anymore to bypass safetynet)
 - WireGuard VPN support
 - CPU Governors: schedutil, powersave and performance.
 - exFAT support (thanks Arter97)
 - Use /dev/urandom instead of /dev/random
 - Boeffla's Wakelock blocker (TEMPORARY)
 - Disabled debugfs
 - Use @kerneltoast 's his SLMK instead of LMK
 
Dont bother asking for extra features like underclock and overclock etc because its not happening.

This kernel is made by Lacia~chan
